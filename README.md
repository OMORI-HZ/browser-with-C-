***# browser-with-C++***
browser with c++ and qmake ðŸ˜ƒðŸ›œ

```Explanation:```
Includes and Initialization:

The program starts by including necessary headers from the Qt library.
The QApplication object is created to manage application-wide resources.
Browser Class:

Inherits from QMainWindow.
Contains a QWebEngineView to display web pages.
A toolbar (QToolBar) is added for navigation controls.
Actions for back, forward, reload, and home navigation are created and connected to the corresponding slots.
A URL bar (QLineEdit) is added for user input and connected to the method to navigate to the URL entered.
Slots and Methods:

navigate_home() sets the browser to Google's homepage.
navigate_to_url() retrieves the text from the URL bar, converts it to a QUrl, and sets it as the new URL for the QWebEngineView.
update_url() updates the URL bar with the current URL whenever the web view's URL changes.
Main Function:

Initializes the QApplication and creates an instance of the Browser class.
The main event loop (app.exec()) is started, which handles user input and updates the GUI.

```Summary:```
Install Qt: Download and install the necessary Qt components.
Write Code: Implement the browser using Qtâ€™s QWebEngineView for rendering web pages.
Create Project File: Define a .pro file to specify project settings.
Compile and Run: Use qmake and make to build the project and then execute the binary.
This will create and launch a basic web browser with navigation controls and a URL bar using C++ and the Qt framework.
